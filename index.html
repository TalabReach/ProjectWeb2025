            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>Studyportals started as a group of international student associations coming together to solve a student problem. At the time, students had no reliable, comprehensive source to compare their study choice options across borders, even though it is one of the most expensive and often one of the most impactful decisions in one’s lifetime. Studyportals was created to fill this gap. </p>
            <p class="pharagaph1">Studyportals co-founder and CEO Edwin van Rest returned to the Netherlands after a transformative experience studying in Japan, and realised the need for a global platform to make education transparent.</p>
